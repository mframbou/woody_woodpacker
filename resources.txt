    Map in the umodified target ELF executable and the user-supplied payload, a position-independent blob
    Locate the first executable segment by parsing program headers
    Locate the last section in the executable segment by parsing section headers
    Expand the last section (in the segment) section header's sh_size and program header's p_memsz/p_filesz by the size of the user-supplied payload
    Fixup section headers' sh_offset's and program headers' p_offset's (move down sections and segments to make room for the payload and a small "stager stub")
    Fix offsets in the ELF header (e_shoff, e_phoff, etc..)
    Modify the ELF header e_entry (ELF entrypoint offset) to point to the injected code
    Create a new ELF containing the injected code and modified ELF headers

Program header table: contains a list of SEGMENTS, each describing a part of the file to be loaded in memory (mostly useful for execution)
Section header table: contains a list of SECTIONS, each describing a logical part of the file (mostly useful for linking and debugging)
